    <pre>If you accidentally entered gamil.com instead of gmail.com when providing your email address, here’s what could happen and how to fix it:

What Happened?
The email was sent to a wrong domain (gamil.com instead of gmail.com).

Since gamil.com is not a valid domain (unlike gmail.com), the email likely bounced back (was not delivered).

If someone else owns gamil.com, they might receive your email (but this is rare).

Solutions to Recover the Email
Contact the Sender

If possible, ask the sender to resend the email to the correct address (@gmail.com).

Example: "I mistakenly gave you 'gamil.com' instead of 'gmail.com'. Could you please resend the email?"

Check for Typos in Your Email

If you registered an account somewhere with gamil.com, update it immediately to gmail.com.

Try Registering gamil.com (Unlikely Solution)

If gamil.com is available (unregistered), you could buy it and set up email forwarding to your real gmail.com (but this is costly and impractical).

Check Spam/Junk Folder (Just in Case)

Sometimes, emails land in spam. Check your Gmail spam folder in case it was corrected automatically (rare, but possible).</pre>
